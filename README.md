# KeeperReactApp
This is the clone of the Google Keeper App made using States and Hooks in react.js
• Created separate components for Notes,input Area, header and footer.
• Added the features to dynamically Add and Delete Nodes by passing required
parameters to each of the components.

You can perform all sort of CRUD operations through this app swiftly.
